# Book Recommendations App.

Welcome to my book recommendations app. I've build this app with as a demo for what can be done using the [Sentence-Transformers Library](https://www.sbert.net/).

You can try this app directly on Streamlit cloud [here](https://share.streamlit.io/dmancevo/bookrecommender/main/WebApp.py).

Alternatively you can download this repo and run it locally as follows:

Install:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run: `streamlit run WebApp.py`
